<h1 align="center">[WIP] </br>Access Control Module For NestJs </br>CASL + NestJS</h1>

More flexible and integrated approach, than suggested by the Nest documentation:

- Permissions defined separately for each module
- In separate module permissions defined in one place with short and readable form
- Access must be controlled by:
  - Role
  - Condition (e.g. user is owner of resource)
  - Permitted fields of resourse (Different roles can have full or partial access to modify resource)
  - Combination of the above
- Ð¡onfigurable Guard for every protected endpoint
